# cosmic_number_4
I saw a Vsauce video (https://youtu.be/csInNn6pfT4) and found a part that i liked (12:53). So i decided to make a program that displays the name of the number, counts its letters and uses that number to do it again and again untill the number 4 would repeat forever. I have allowed to put in max number 999'999'999. It will display the name of this number and take the amount of letters of this number and writes that one out, counts that one and so on and so on...
